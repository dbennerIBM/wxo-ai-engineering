# Building better RAG agents with Docling Granite 4, Granite embedding models, and Elasticsearch 
## This guide specifically covers Enterprise and Platinum versions of Elasticsearch on IBM Cloud and IBM TechZone which both use ES version 8.x and typically 8.15

Here are some links to learn more about Granite Docling multimodal image-text-to-text model for efficient document conversion:

The intent of the RAG_pipeline_docling_granite_elasticsearch.ipynb is to provide a complete RAG pipeline for Elasticsearch vector databases. A key focus is to see how to simple it is to implement Granite Docling in a RAG pipeline.
